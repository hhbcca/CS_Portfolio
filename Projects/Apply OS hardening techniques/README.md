# Activity: Analyze network layer communication


## Objective

In this activity, you will analyze DNS and ICMP traffic in transit using data from a network protocol analyzer tool. You will identify which network protocol was utilized in assessment of the cybersecurity incident. 

In the internet layer of the TCP/IP model, the IP formats data packets into IP datagrams. The information provided in the datagram of an IP packet can provide security analysts with insight into suspicious data packets in transit.

Knowing how to identify potentially malicious traffic on a network can help cybersecurity analysts assess security risks on a network and reinforce network security.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.

## Steps

### Step 1: Access the template

### Step 3: Provide a summary of the problem found in the tcpdump log
After analyzing the data presented to you from the tcpdump log, identify trends in the data. Assess which protocol is producing the error message from the DNS server for the yummyrecipesforme.com website. Recall that one of the ports that is displayed repeatedly is port 53, commonly used for DNS. In your analysis:  

- Include a brief summary of the tcpdump log analysis and identify which protocols were used for the network traffic.

- Provide a few details about what was indicated in the log.

- Interpret the issues found in the log.

- Record your responses in part one of the cybersecurity incident report.  

### Step 4: Explain your analysis of the data and provide one solution to implement 
Now that youâ€™ve inspected the traffic log and identified trends in the traffic, describe why the error messages appeared on the log. Use your answer in the previous step and the scenario to identify the reason behind the ICMP error messages. The error messages indicate that there is an issue with a specific port. What do the different protocols involved in the log reveal about the incident? In your response:

- State when the problem was first reported.

- Provide the scenario, events, and symptoms identified when the event was first reported.

- Explain the current status of the issue.  

- Describe the information discovered while investigating the issue up to this point.

- List the next steps in troubleshooting and resolving the issue.

- Provide the suspected root cause of the problem.

- Record your responses in part two of the cybersecurity incident report.
